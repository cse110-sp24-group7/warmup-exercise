## Role of Button Routing

Buttons will be used to take the user between the two pages that make up the widget.

## Intended Purpose

When the user clicks on the submit button on the starting page, it should take them to the page containing the quote and "yelp reviews". When the user clicks on the Load Reviews button, it should show them a couple of other things that people have said on the widget that were similar.

## Implementation/Syntax Approaches?

HTML

## Testing

LiveServer editing
