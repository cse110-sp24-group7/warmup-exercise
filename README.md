### About the widget:

We have designed an interactive, fully functional sentiment widget that helps you record your emotions in an exciting and entertaining way! Our widget works on a **rainbow** scale, where a user picks a color on the rainbow to indicate how they feel that day. When a user hovers over a selection on the rainbow, the displayed emoji will mirror the user's emotion, allowing for a seamless UI with great responsiveness.

For an even better user experience, the background of the page also changes to match the emotion picked by the user. The sentiment widget's visuals, responsiveness, and added features help it stand out among a crowd of emotion-centered apps today.

When the user clicks the "Submit" button, they are led to another page where a quote is generated based on their sentiment, to either motivate or encourage them. Additionally, the user has the option to read responses by other users that match their sentiment. Psychologically, this allows the user to feel included within a community, encouraging them to use the widget daily.
