# Documentation for Information Tab and Group Logo
## Role of Display Quote

For a better user experience, add in some instructions and explanation of what the sentiment widget is meant to do and how it is intended to be used. 

## Intended Purpose: User Story

As a user, I want an instructions tab in the widget that seamlessly blends in without having writing all over the page. I would like a small question-mark button that displays a pop-up with the instructions when I click it, so that this doesn't cloud too much of the widget when I'm using the widget for a second time and know how to use it. 

As a developer, I want a seamless way to integrate instructions with the widget, and have a pop-up window that can easily be opened and closed. For branding purposes, I also want to include our team logo at the bottom of the page.


## Implementation/Syntax Approaches?

Integration of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Testing

LiveServer editing using Devtools
