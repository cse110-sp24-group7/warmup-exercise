# Documentation for Button Routing

## Role of Button Routing

Button routing enables easy traversal back and forth between the two pages that our widget uses.

## Intended Purpose: User Story

As a user, when I click on the submit button on the starting page, I would like the page to route me to the page with a quote about my mood and other user responses. This would allow a more social aspect in the widget/application, and provide a better managed user experience.
As a user, I also would like for the Load Reviews button to show me other people who are in a similar mood as I am, rather than random reviews. This will help validate my sentiment on a use-by-use basis and promote retention.

## Implementation/Syntax Approaches?

HTML

## Testing

LiveServer editing and deployment to enhance user experience.
