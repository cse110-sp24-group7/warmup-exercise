# Documentation for Gradient Background

## Role of Gradient Background

Depending on the location of the users mouse, the background gradient changes. This provides a cleaner, more appealing user experience.

## Intended Purpose: User Story

As a user, when I hover my mouse over a selection, I would like the background gradient to change. This would help emphasize the mood that I have selected. From a design philosophy, I want to see some sort of response to my actions on the widget.

## Implementation/Syntax Approaches?

Javascript integrated with HTML following different cases for different selections.

## Testing

LiveServer editing and deployment to enhance user experience.
