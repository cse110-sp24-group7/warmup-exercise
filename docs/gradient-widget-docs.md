Visuals for sentiment tracker

## Intended Purpose

The first page of the sentiment tracker. Hover over the colors, and a corresponding

semicircle implementation converted into a bar gradient visual. Two different incomplete
semicircle visuals can be found in [semicircle-progress](semicircle-progress).
