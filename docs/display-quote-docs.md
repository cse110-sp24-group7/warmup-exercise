# Documentation for Display Quote Functionality

## Role of Display Quote

Based on user rating, display a randomly selected quote that correlates to the rating.

## Intended Purpose

When user selects their rating, there should be a randomized quote generated that correlates to the rating they just inputted. Generate a random index using math.random and draw a quote from quotes_ratings.js. 

Create display_quote.html and utilize scripts tags to import relevant files. Form that prompts user input to give a rating, and when they click submit, generateRandomQuote function from display_quotes.js returns a randomized quote based on the rating. Finally this quote is displayed.
