# Documentation for Display Quote Functionality

## Role of Display Quote

Display quote to be shown upon the user's submission, ideally correlating to the rating that the user inputted as well.

## Intended Purpose: User Story

As a user, when I select my rating, I would like there to be a randomized quote generated that correlates to the rating I just inputted. This would motivate me if I'm having a bad day or encourage me if I'm having a good one.

As a developer, I want the quote to be randomized using math.random and I would draw a quote from quotes_ratings.js.

Create display_quote.html and utilize scripts tags to import relevant files. Form that prompts user input to give a rating, and when they click submit, generateRandomQuote function from display_quotes.js returns a randomized quote based on the rating. Finally this quote is displayed.

## Implementation/Syntax Approaches?

JavaScript and integration with HTML

## Testing

LiveServer editing and deployment to enhance user experience.
