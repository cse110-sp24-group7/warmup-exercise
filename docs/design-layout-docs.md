# Documentation for the Design and HTML Layout

## Role of the Design and Layout

Designing and laying out the widget helps to structure and create the workflows needed to complete the rest of the app.

## Intended Purpose: User Story

As a user, I would like a semicircle or rectangular widget that I can hover through and see change with my mouse position over it. I want to see 7 emojis that represent 7 different emotions and their respective colors (a rainbow).
As a user, I want a "yelp review" component that shows me other comments that people have saved from their day. This would motivate a social aspect for the platform and would encourage me to use the widget more often.

## Implementation/Syntax Approaches?

Started with a rough sketch of the widget by hand on Miro, then as the features we wanted got clearer and more concrete, we created more defined sketches using the shape tools on Miro, and then finally we created the wireframe with arrows connecting the flows and what would trigger those flows, such as hovering or clicking. With the HTML layout, we figured the semi-circle might be hard, so we set our backup to be a linear bar that would have the same function. The other HTML aspects were not as complex, so we did a quick design meant to be refined later that represented the general idea.

## Testing

LiveServer editing and deployment to enhance user experience, Miro board to visualize ideas and share with the team.
