# Documentation for the Design and HTML Layout

## Role of the Design and Layout

Designing and laying out the widget helps to structure and create the workflows needed to complete the rest of the app.

## Intended Purpose

We wanted a start page that has a little semicircle where the user can hover through and see all of the 7 emojis that represent 7 different emotions and their respective colors. We also wanted a "yelp review" component that shows the user other comments that people have saved from their day. Some othe features we might add later on are common phrases that are graphically displayed based on frequency, and perhaps different color themes.

## Implementation/Syntax Approaches?

Started with a rough sketch of the widget by hand on Miro, then as the features we wanted got clearer and more concrete, we created more defined sketches using the shape tools on Miro, and then finally we created the wireframe with arrows connecting the flows and what would trigger those flows, such as hovering or clicking. With the HTML layout, we figured the semi-circle might be hard, so we set our backup to be a linear bar that would have the same function. The other HTML aspects were not as complex, so we did a quick design meant to be refined later that represented the general idea.

## Testing

LiveServer editing, Miro
