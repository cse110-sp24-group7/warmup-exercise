# Documentation for Information Tab and Group Logo
## Role of Display Quote

For a better user experience, add in some instructions and explanation of what the sentiment widget is meant to do and how it is intended to be used. 

## Intended Purpose

We wanted a seamless way to integrate instructions into the widget. We didnt want it to be too clunky and have writing all over the page, so we opted to having a small questionmark button that would display a popup with the instructions. This is a pretty symbol to have for this type of button so using code to create a popup window that could easily be opened and closed was what we settled on.

To add a nice branding touch we thought it would be a good idea to add our team logo. With the placement of the questionmark icon it made the most sense to include this on the bottom of the page.
